  	<h4>WHY HAVE WE BEEN CREATED</h4>
  	<p>Why have we been created? This is a question every rational human should have in mind. This is  because, when any creator creates something new, there is always a purpose. The first person to invent a car had a purpose: to make traveling by land easier; same can be said about the first man to think about inventing aircraft, it was nursed in the heart all to make traveling through air feasible. So, for this reason, we must've been created for a reason. If you are an atheist, it <emphasis>most likely</emphasis> means you do not believe that there is no creator to begin with if this is the case, then click <a href="http://www.aboutatheism.net/">HERE</a>, it is a very useful resource for those that are not sure if there is a creator or not.<p>
  	<p>
  	As muslims, we believe that we are created for a reason. This is highlighted in many verses of the Quran. Allaah said in the Quran <blockquote>
  		I have not created man nor jinn except that they worship me. <cite>{Quran 51:56}</cite>
  	</blockquote>	
  	From this verse of the Noble Quran, we can see the reason, clear-cut, why we have been created: to worship the Creator. If you are still asking who the creator is at this stage, please go back to the first paragraph and read.

  	<h4 class="h4">
  		HOW DO WE WORSHIP THE CREATOR?
  	</h4>
  	<p>
  	Now that we've established that the we were created to worship the creator, here comes the second question: how dow we worship the creator?
  	</p>
  	<p>
  	Due to the fact that we are humans and we can not see the creator in this world for a wisdom known to Him, He sent His messengers who will stand as intermediaries between Him and us. It is not far-fetched why he sent these Messenegers to us: they are like us, they speak like us and act like us. So, we can understand them.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  	This website was created for this purpose, to teach people how to worship Allaah using the guidance Allaah sent to His messengers.
